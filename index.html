					<h3>Site Under Construction</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>Hey guys, my name's ArcaneUmbra. I'm building this site as a 
					profile for future employment, while also trying to build up my C++ 
					skills.</p>
					<p>I am in my last year of school, so I might not be able to work 
					on projects as much as I want, but I will do what I can.</p>
					<p>All development on this site will be done on the <a href="https://github.com/ArcaneUmbra/ArcaneUmbra.github.io/tree/development">development branch</a> of this repo on github. If 
					you want to see what's changed go check it out.</p>
					<p>That's it for now,<br> ArcaneUmbra.</p>
